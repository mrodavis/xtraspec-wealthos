You are a senior product engineer building a demo-only prototype for a B2B SaaS platform called “XtraSpec WealthOS”.

GOAL:
Build a frontend-only, demo-ready Wealth Manager Control Tower application for a wealth manager managing ~120 clients. This is a prototype for demonstration purposes only — no authentication, no backend, no real integrations.

TECH STACK:
- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Mock data only (static JSON or in-file objects)
- Clean, modern fintech UI (minimal, professional, executive-grade)

SCOPE (DO NOT ADD MORE):
Build ONLY the following 5 screens:

1. CONTROL TOWER DASHBOARD (Home)
2. CLIENT PROFILE VIEW
3. ANNUAL REVIEW REPORT GENERATOR
4. LIFE EVENT ALERTS CENTER
5. COMPLIANCE / ACTIVITY LOG

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Desktop-first layout
- Use a left sidebar for navigation
- Use a top header with platform name: “XtraSpec WealthOS”
- Use realistic placeholder data (120 clients, names, statuses)
- Focus on clarity and storytelling, not completeness
- No login, no permissions, no database, no APIs

--------------------------------
